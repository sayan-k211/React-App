    "description": "The Mulhausen Report [document00.023.603] details the discovery of SCP-002, describing it as a large, fleshy growth resembling a tumor. The object has a volume of approximately 60 cubic meters (or 2000 cubic feet) and features an iron valve hatch leading to its interior. Inside, there's a room resembling a standard low-rent apartment, complete with furniture made from biological substances like bone and hair, each with its own unique DNA sequence. Notably, the room has a window that is only visible from the inside. The report likely provides further insights into the circumstances surrounding SCP-002's discovery and initial containment.",
    "specialContainmentProcedures": "SCP-002 is to remain connected to a suitable power supply at all times, to keep it in what appears to be a recharging mode. In case of electrical outage, the emergency barrier between the object and the facility is to be closed and the immediate area evacuated. Once facility power is re-established, alternating bursts of X-ray and ultraviolet light must strobe the area until SCP-002 is re-affixed to the power supply and returned to recharging mode. Containment area is to be kept at negative air pressure at all times.\n\nTeams including a minimum of two (2) members are required within 20 meters of SCP-002 or its containment area. Personnel should maintain physical contact with one another at all times to confirm there is another person present, as perception may be dulled, skewed, or influenced by proximity to the object.\n\nNo personnel below Level 3 are permitted within SCP-002. This requirement may be waived via written authorization from two (2) off-site Level 4 administrators. Command staff issued such a waiver must be escorted by at least five (5) Level 3 Security personnel for the duration of their contact and must temporarily surrender their rank and security clearance. Following contact, command staff will be escorted at least 5 km from SCP-002 to undergo a seventy-two (72)-hour quarantine and psychological evaluation. If deemed fit for return to duty by psych staff, rank and security clearance may be restored when quarantine expires.",
    "references": "The following is a brief report detailing the discovery of SCP-002: Subject was discovered in a small crater in northern Portugal where it struck the Earth from orbit. Encased in a shell of thick rock, the fleshy exterior of the object was exposed by the impact. A native farmer happened upon the site and reported his findings to the village elder. Subject gained SCP attention when a Level 4 agent posted in the area detected a small radioactive anomaly generated by the object. A collection squad of SCP security personnel led by General Mulhausen was immediately dispatched to the area where they quickly secured the subject in a large container and performed initial testing with subjects recruited from the nearby village. Three men individually sent into the structure subsequently disappeared. Upon discovering this deadly property of the subject, General Mulhausen issued a Level 4a Termination Order of any witnesses (roughly 1/3 of the village) to ensure no outside knowledge of the object and initiated its transport to SCP facility [DATA EXPUNGED]. During preparation for transport, four SCP security personnel were inexplicably drawn inside the object where they too immediately disappeared. Following inspection, it appeared as if the object had 'grown' several new furnishings and was beginning to look like the interior of an apartment room. General Mulhausen immediately ordered the requisition of several Class III HAZMAT suits for the remaining security team members, who proceeded to lift the container onto a waiting freight ship for transport to the SCP containment facility. [DATA EXPUNGED] [DATA EXPUNGED] Following the termination of General Mulhausen, SCP-002 was re-secured by SCP staff and brought into special containment in [CLASSIFIED], where it currently resides. Staff with clearance below Level 3 have been denied access to the SCP-002 container without prior approval of at least two Level 4 staff after the Mulhausen incident.",

    "Item": "SCP-003",
    "Class": "Euclid",
    "description": "SCP-003 comprises SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2, two enigmatic components. SCP-003-1 resembles a sentient motherboard, while SCP-003-2 is a rune-covered stone tablet housing a mysterious internal computer. Exposure to temperatures below 35°C triggers reactions in both components. SCP-003-1 exhibits exponential growth, fueled by surrounding matter, while SCP-003-2 emits radiation to control it. Despite extensive study, their origins and connections to other SCP objects remain elusive.",
    "specialContainmentProcedures": "SCP-003 is to be maintained at a constant temperature of no less than 35°C and ideally kept above 100°C. No living multicellular organisms of Category IV or higher complexity may be allowed to come into contact with SCP-003.\n\nIn event of total power failure, if SCP-003-1 begins to increase its mass, assigned personnel must engage in skin contact with SCP-003-1. Ideally, personnel may use their body heat to return SCP-003-1 to above the critical temperature; however, skin contact must be maintained even in event of SCP-003 reaching activation temperature, lasting at minimum until SCP-003-1 advances fully to its second growth stage.\n\nPersonnel who enter SCP-003's containment area must first be examined for body parasites of Category IV or higher complexity, and sterilized if such organisms are present. All personnel who have come in physical contact with SCP-003-1 are to immediately report for sterilization afterwards.\n\nSCP-003-1 must not be removed from SCP-003-2 except in case of emergency procedures detailed above. Any significant change in SCP-003-2's rune activity (including pattern, frequency, or color) should be reported within three (3) hours of occurrence. Cessation of rune activity must be reported immediately. SCP-003-2 must be supplied with power via the source designated Generator 003-IX at all times.",
    "references": "During M03-Gloria procedures, SCP-003-1 doubled its mass and began rapid structural growth. Temperature was immediately returned to 100°C. Growth and mass increase of SCP-003-1 continued for 9 minutes and 6 seconds, at which time a sustained radiation spike was produced by SCP-003-2. In response, SCP-003-1 returned to its normal state in 3 minutes and 39 seconds. New growth dissolved into a dusty residue which was collected for analysis. Both SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2 ceased all detectable activity. SCP-003-2 did not resume activity until connected to external power source. SCP-003-2's runes glowed uniformly gray and did not resume normal activity for three (3) hours. SCP-003-2 no longer appears to be able to maintain containment area at a temperature above 35°C without external power supplied by Generators 003-III through IX.",

    "Class": "Euclid",
    "description": "SCP-004 consists of SCP-004-1, an old barn door, and SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, rusted keys. Opening SCP-004-1 with the keys leads to deadly outcomes, including disappearance or dismemberment of individuals. Temporal and spatial anomalies are associated with SCP-004, with instances of missing individuals reappearing and SCP-004-7 opening into an alternate dimension. Ongoing research explores SCP-004's effects and the potential of the keys to open other anomalous doors. SCP-004-14, a wooden box, can make items vanish irretrievably when closed and locked.",
    "specialContainmentProcedures": "When handling items SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13, proper procedure is vital. The items are not permitted to be moved off-site unless accompanied by two Level 4 security personnel...\n\nLevel 1 clearance is required for basic access to SCP-004-1; Level 4 clearance is required for use of SCP-004-2 to -13.",
    "references": "Appendix A: Mental Health Effects of SCP-004-12\nAll Class D personnel using SCP-004-12 return in a catatonic state, unable to speak. Some may have enough energy left to try to claw out their eyes. Of the 16 subjects, only 4 have survived. Only one has regained speech, following long-term psychotherapy. He was able to tell the psychiatrist that he saw a massive green creature, so large that much of its body extended beyond his field of view. He reported innate fear and sudden recognition, \"as if it were something buried deep in [his] primal fears,\" and forced implantation of \"incomprehensible\" memories. Subject displays acute anterograde and retrograde amnesia.\n\nAppendix B: Additional Information\nItem #: SCP-004-14\n\nDate of Discovery: 09/02/1950\n\nOrigin of Object: Object was discovered elsewhere in factory area, in the previously undiscovered manager's office.\n\nDescription: Object appears as a large, unvarnished wooden box. The box may be unlocked by the \"safe\" key, SCP-004-7, as well as five of the \"unsafe\" keys (see Document SCP-004-1). Upon unlocking SCP-004-14 with SCP-004-7, the box opens automatically on hinges. The volume of the space inside is precisely five times greater than the outer dimensions imply. Items placed within while the lid remains open do not affect the weight or any other properties of the box. When the lid is closed and locked, however, all items inside vanish irretrievably. Personnel locked inside the box are also irretrievable, although losing personnel in this fashion appears to affect significantly the dreams experienced by [DATA EXPUNGED].",

    "Item": "SCP-005",
    "Class": "Safe",
    "description": "SCP-005 is an ornate key resembling those from the 1920s. It possesses the unique ability to unlock any lock, whether mechanical or digital, with ease. However, attempts to disguise locks have shown some success in defeating its ability, suggesting a level of sentience. Use of SCP-005 as a security pass replacement requires Level 4 supervision and is prohibited for personal use or vending machine repairs. Removal from the compound results in immediate termination. Ongoing tests aim to understand its cognitive abilities.",
    "specialContainmentProcedures": "SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area.",
    "references": "Appendix A:\nWhile SCP-005 has been shown to be effective in removing almost any form of locking device, further experiments have shown that efforts to disguise the purpose or identity of a lock have proven at least somewhat successful in defeating SCP-005's ability. In approximately 50% of cases where a volunteer was not able to identify a locking device as such, SCP-005 was not successful in deactivating the device. Due to these results, SCP-005 has been tentatively classified as 'sentient' and further tests are being run to determine its cognitive abilities. However, there are no results that show any traits that prevent it from being able to identify any particular locking device, only that the aforementioned device has been heavily concealed and disguised.",

    "Class": "Safe",
    "description": "SCP-006 is a small spring located west of Astrakhan, known since the 19th century but secured by the Foundation in 1991 due to political obstacles. Disguised as a chemical factory, the spring emits mineral water with remarkable healing properties. Ingestion enhances human DNA regeneration, tissue repair, and immune system effectiveness. Animal testing showed immediate destruction of hostile bacteria and viruses, with higher primates experiencing similar benefits to humans.",
    "specialContainmentProcedures": "Whereas the nature of SCP-006 does not warrant any extensive containment, a certain level of secrecy is necessary regarding the object's existence and properties, for obvious reasons. The following procedures are required not for personnel safety, but to deny or hide knowledge of SCP-006's effects from the personnel who interact with it.\n\nAll personnel interacting with SCP-006 in any physical way are required to wear modified Class VI BNC suits. Before personnel are allowed to perform procedures, they must be briefed with Material SCP-006B or SCP-006C. SCP-006A Briefing is the correct one and is restricted to only those with O5 clearance. To ensure personnel are wearing suits properly, they are to be submerged into a pool of water. Any air bubbles spotted signify a leak in the suit.\nProcedures with SCP-006 are to be carried out under extreme surveillance. In case of contact with SCP-006, the commander in charge will announce Procedure 006-Xi-12, which the personnel have been briefed to believe to mean high toxicity is present and they must evacuate.\nAny procedure in which liquid is acquired from SCP-006 must be approved by three (3) O5 level personnel. The liquid is to be transferred in a Quad-Sealant Container and under armed guard.\nIf at any time personnel come into contact with SCP-006 or liquid from SCP-006, they are to be confined and terminated after sufficient studies are done. Due to the nature of SCP-006, the most effective termination method is incineration. (For full report, see file SCP006-TerO5)",
